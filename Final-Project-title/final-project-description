  <title>Trimmers Hair Salon</title>

<body>
<p1>Trimmer's Hair salon has been serving Boonton, New Jersey for over 20 years but only recognized through the community. 
Very little information about the business can be found on the internet other than a phone number.
While the salon is successful it lacks in having a website to get their name out there. 
I would like to help my cousin and her busniess by designing a website to provide more information about the salon,
and attract new clients. By creating this website I would be able to highlight her services, provide pricing, and put pictures to the name.
